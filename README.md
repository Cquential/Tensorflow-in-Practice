# Tensorflow in Practice Specialization

This is my solution and the empty notebooks for the Coursera Specialization [Tensorflow in Practice](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice)
I am unable to upload the requisite data for training and validation due to Github's 100MB storage limit. However, I have attached the link at which they will be publicly available. The zip file contains all the images and the pretrained model that are utilised in both courses and is around 330 MB to download.

I have also uploaded the empty notebooks should the viewer attempt to try for themselves to finish the exercises, with the solutions accompanying them to verify their attempt.

Download the requisite data for the notebooks [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TJ0t8Cx6iw3rol3X03KyRFgt6sAEgBxq/view?usp=sharing)
